# **The Brief**

## **Ice Breaker**

This is a fun little assessment that allows the Specno team to gauge your skillset as well as the conventions and style of programming through which you express all your marvellous creations! We want to encourage you to be creative and have fun while creating this prototype!

## **Objective**

Reddit is a network of communities where people can dive into their interests, hobbies, and passions. Your goal is to build a makeshift Reddit API. This API needs to comply with the following criteria.

- A user should be able to create posts as well as update and delete those posts.
- Users should be able to upvote (like) or downvote (dislike) those posts.
- Users should be able to comment on posts.
- A User should be able to upvote or downvote comments.
- A user should be able to query all the posts that they have created.
- A user should be able to query all the posts that they have upvoted or downvoted.
- A user should be able to see all the posts created by a specific user by using their username.
- Viewing any post should show you all the comments for that post as well as how many people upvoted or downvoted the post.

## **Constraints**

- Must be build in JS.
- Hosted on AWS/GCP.
- Ensure that you use clear commit messages and version control standards (branching strategies, etc)
- The [README.md](http://readme.md/) file should be well-documented with clear instructions on how to run the API. Please feel free to share a link to saved Postman Requests.

## **Bonus Points (Optional, but Recommended)**

- Full Authentication with Password hashing
- Hash (Encrypt and Decrypt) IDs to add security to your database.
- Order comments by number of likes.
- Paginate the posts
